But as someone who believes in change we're not going anywhere in that direction.

We're a company in a deep sense of optimism. Our founders want to take what they have. We want to change things for the better. This year we've started working on new products and improvements along the way. We're looking forward to launching things for both Android and iOS. We're a product driven company and it's extremely exciting to see how the growth has been. There are still three months left before the company has had any plans to be able to release any of our latest Android and iOS projects.

We've been making incremental improvements for a long time now and there's more improvements coming. These updates reflect where we are at, what we're doing and what the business needs. If not now now, we're in a position now where we need a lot of focus in one direction. We're working with an ongoing research and development pipeline.

It's not a short term or short-sighted decision and there is good and bad news. There are significant steps we can take to ensure that any change doesn't end up hurting our business, not having the desired change. We want to focus more on what the consumer wants and what we provide. So there is going to be changes that happen soon and there is going to be a lot of positive changes, and that is what this company will be
